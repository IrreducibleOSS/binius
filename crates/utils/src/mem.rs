		// The `slice` is a valid mutable reference, so:
		// - Its pointer is non-null and properly aligned
		// - It points to `len` consecutive properly initialized values of type T
		// - The memory region is valid for reads and writes
		// - The memory belongs to a single allocated object
		// - The total size is no larger than isize::MAX and doesn't wrap around the address space
		//
		// By casting the pointer to `*mut MaybeUninit<T>`, we're essentially forgetting that
		// the values are initialized. This is safe because:
		// 1. We've asserted that T doesn't have a destructor, so no cleanup is needed,
		// 2. `MaybeUninit<T>` has the same memory layout as T,
		// 3. We maintain the same length.
		//
		// The returned slice takes over the lifetime of the input slice making the lifetime
		// correct.
