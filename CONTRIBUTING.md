## Style Guide & Conventions

Many code formatting and style rules are enforced using
[rustfmt](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html#automatic-formatting-with-rustfmt)
and [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/). The remaining sections document conventions that cannot be enforced
with automated tooling.

### Running automated checks

You can run the formatter and linter with

```bash
$ cargo fmt
$ cargo clippy --all --all-features --tests --benches --examples -- -D warnings
```

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks are configured to run `rustfmt`.

### Documentation

We follow guidance from the [rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html). The
["Documenting components"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html#documenting-components)
section is quite prescriptive. To copy verbatim:

> It is recommended that each item's documentation follows this basic structure:
>
> ```
> [short sentence explaining what it is]
> 
> [more detailed explanation]
> 
> [at least one code example that users can copy/paste to try it]
> 
> [even more advanced explanations if necessary]
> ```

Documentation and commit messages should be written in the present tense. For example,

```
❌ This function will return the right answer
✅ This function returns the right answer

❌ Fixed the bug in the gizmo
✅ Fix the bug in the gizmo
```

### Naming philosophy & conventions

This codebase biases towards longer, more descriptive names for identifiers. This extends to the names of generic type
parameters.

#### Generic parameter names

In idiomatic Rust code, generic parameters are often identified by single letters or short, capitalized abbreviations.
We tend to prefer more descriptive, CamelCase identifiers for type parameters, especially for methods that have more
than one or two type parameters. There are some exceptions for common type parameters that have single-letter
abbreviations. They are:

* `F` indicates a `Field` parameter
* `P` indicates a `PackedField` parameter
* `U` indicates a `UnderlierType` parameter
* `M` indicates a `MultilinearPoly` parameter

If a function or struct is generic over multiple types implementing those traits, the type names should start with the
single-letter abbreviation. For example, a function that is parameterized by multiple fields may name them
`F`, `FSub`, `FDomain`, `FEncode`, etc., where `FSub` is a subfield of `F`, `FDomain` is a field used as an evaluation
domain, and `FEncode` is used as the field of an encoding matrix.

#### Use namespacing

If an identifier is defined in a module and is unambigious in the context of that module, it does _not_ need to
duplicate the module name into the identifier. For example, we have many protocols defined in `binius_core::protocols`
that expose a `prove` and `verify` method. Because they are namespaced within the protocol modules, for example the
`sumcheck` module, these identifiers do not need to be named `sumcheck_verify` and `sumcheck_prove`. The caller has the
option of referring to these functions as `sumcheck::prove` / `sumcheck::verify` or renaming the imported symbol, like
`use sumcheck::prove as sumcheck_prove`.

### Unwrap

Don't call `unwrap` in library code. Either throw or propagate an `Err` or call `expect`, leaving an explanation of why
the code will not panic. Unwrap is fine in test code.

Example from the [Substrate style guide](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#style):

```rust
let mut target_path =
	self.path().expect(
		"self is instance of DiskDirectory;\
		DiskDirectory always returns path;\
		qed"
	);
```

## Prover-verifier separation

Verifier code is optimized for simplicity, security, and readability, whereas prover code is optimized for performance.
This naturally means there are different conventions and standards for verifier and prover code. Some notable
differences are

* Prover code often uses packed fields; verifier code should only use scalar fields.
* Prover code often uses subfields; verifier code should primarily use a single field.
* Prover code often uses Rayon for multithreaded parallelization; verifier code should not use Rayon.
* Prover code can use complex data structures like hash maps; verifier code prefer direct-mapped indexes.
* Prover code can use more experimental dependencies; verifier code should be conservative with dependencies.

## Dependencies

We use plenty of useful crates from the Rust ecosystem. When including a crate as a dependency, be sure to assess:

* Is it widely used? You can see when it was published and total downloads on `crates.io`.
* Is it maintained? If the documentation has an explicit deprecation notice or has not been updated in a long time, try
  to find an alternative.
* Is it developed by one person or an organization?

## First-time contributions

The project welcomes first time contributions from developers who want to learn more about Binius and make an impact
on the open source cryptography community.

If you are new to the project and don't know where to start, you can look for [open issues labeled
`good first issue`](/IrreducibleOSS/binius/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A"good%20first%20issue") or add
test coverage for existing code. Adding unit tests is a great way to learn how to interact with the codebase, make a
meaningful contribution, and maybe even find bugs!

On the other hand, _we do not accept typo fix PRs from first-time contributors_. These are not significant enough to
justify the additional work for maintainers nor any potential benefits, tangible or intangible, one might get from
being listed as a contributor to the repo.
